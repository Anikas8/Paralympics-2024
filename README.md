# Paralympics-2024
Paris Paralympics Python Visualization
### Overview:
In addition to the Olympic Dashboard, I have completed an exploratory data analysis (EDA) project for the Paris Paralympics using Python. This project delves into various aspects of the Paralympic Games, providing a comprehensive view of athlete participation and performance metrics.

#### Key Components of the EDA:
Data Collection: Gathered and cleaned data related to the Paralympic Games, including athlete details, events, and medal counts. Participation Analysis: Analyzed the number of athletes participating from different countries and regions. Explored the medal counts for various countries, categorizing the data into gold, silver, and bronze medals. This analysis highlights the top-performing nations in the Paralympic Games. Visualizations: Utilized libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to create informative visualizations, including bar charts, pie charts, and line graphs. These visuals effectively communicate the insights gained from the data. This Analysis not only complements the Olympic Games analysis but also emphasizes the significance of the Paralympics in promoting inclusivity and showcasing the achievements of athletes with disabilities
